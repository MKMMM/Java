# Tic Tac Toe AI: Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning

The Tic Tac Toe AI leverages the power of the Minimax algorithm to make the gameplay challenging. This application integrates several advanced Java concepts to achieve a well-structured and efficient game.

## Core Features

- **Intelligent AI**: Using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning, the AI predicts multiple moves ahead, ensuring a competitive gameplay experience.
- **Robust OOP Principles**: The application is designed following object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, providing a clear structure and maintainability.

## Key Concepts

1. **Abstract Class**: Used to define a base for other subclasses, giving them a blueprint of methods and variables.
2. **Boxing and Unboxing**: The process of converting a primitive data type into an object and vice versa.
3. **Constructor**: Special methods in classes used to initialize objects.
4. **Debugging Techniques**: Methods and tools used to identify and rectify errors in the code.
5. **Defining Classes**: Creating blueprints for objects which include variables and methods.
6. **Getters and Setters**: Methods that allow reading and modifying private fields of a class.
7. **Hiding and Overriding**: Concepts dealing with method visibility and redefinition in subclasses.
8. **Hierarchy of Exceptions**: The categorization of error types in Java, which allows for tailored error handling.
9. **Instance Methods**: Methods that operate on the instance variables of an object.
10. **Interface**: A blueprint of methods (without bodies) that classes can implement.
11. **Multiple Constructors**: Having several constructors in a class to initialize objects differently.
12. **Objects**: Basic runtime entities in an object-oriented system.
13. **Overloading**: Defining multiple methods in a class with the same name but different parameters.
14. **Package**: A way to group related Java classes/interfaces.
15. **Polymorphism**: Allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class.
16. **Random**: Used to generate random numbers or select random elements.
17. **Recursion**: A technique where a function calls itself.
18. **The Keyword `super`**: Refers to parent class objects. Useful in method overriding and accessing parent class variables.
