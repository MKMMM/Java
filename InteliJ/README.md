# Cinema Room Manager

The Cinema Room Manager is a system designed to manage seating arrangements in a cinema. Using this system, we can control which seats are booked, view available seats, and determine the overall capacity of the cinema hall. 

## Core Concepts

Here are the main programming and design principles used in the implementation of the Cinema Room Manager:

### Functional Decomposition

The project is broken down into smaller, more manageable functions, each performing a specific task. This ensures that each function is responsible for one thing, promoting clarity and maintainability.

### Iterating Over Arrays

Given the need to manage and assess the state of each seat in a cinema room, iteration over arrays plays a crucial role. The system efficiently traverses arrays to read and modify seat bookings.

### Multidimensional Array

Cinema seating can be visualized as a grid, making multidimensional arrays the ideal data structure for representing it. Each row can represent a different row of seats in the cinema, and each element in that row can represent a specific seat (either booked or available).

### Switch Statement

To handle different operations like booking a seat, viewing available seats, or exiting the system, a switch statement is employed. This allows for easy navigation through different functionalities based on user input.
